# Overview
The connection-scan is a route search algorithm for transit networks. The 
algorithm itself is described in various papers ([CSA](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257361294_Intriguingly_Simple_and_Fast_Transit_Routing), [CSA Accelarated](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286955308_Connection_Scan_Accelerated)).
The implementation is developed at the [Institute for Transport Studies]
(http://www.ifv.kit.edu) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
